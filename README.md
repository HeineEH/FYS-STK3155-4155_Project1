In this project we investigate reggression models like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge, and LASSO using custom code. We apply these on the Runge function and play around with higher order polynomials to fit the function. Our models are evaluated with mean square error and R^2 to determine performance. We also cover gradient decent methods and extensions of these. Resampling techniques and bias-variance are also studied.
