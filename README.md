In this project we investigate reggression models like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge, and LASSO using custom code. We apply these on the Runge function and play around with higher order polynomials to fit the function. Our models are evaluated with mean square error and R^2 to determine performance. We also cover gradient decent methods and extensions of these. Resampling techniques and bias-variance are also studied. 

All our code files is located in the folder called "Code". Following are the content of these code notebooks:
Notebook "OLS&Ridge" cover implementation of the OLS and Ridge methods applied on the Runge function. The code produce Figure 3, 4, and 5 in the PDF report file. 
Notebook "GradientDecent" cover implementation of Gradient Decent and produce Figure 6 in the report.
Notebook "GradientDecent" cover implementation of Gradient Decent and produce Figure 6 in the report.
Notebook "GradientDecent" cover implementation of Gradient Decent and produce Figure 6 in the report.

(We are not done yet so we will fill in later)
